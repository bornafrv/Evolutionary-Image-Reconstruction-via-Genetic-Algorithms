# 🧬 EvoPaint: Evolutionary Image Reconstruction via Genetic Algorithms

This project implements a genetic algorithm to reconstruct target images by evolving populations of abstract shapes. Over successive generations, the algorithm optimizes the visual resemblance between a rendered image and a given target, showcasing the creative power of evolutionary computation.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🎯 Fitness-Driven Approximation
Evaluates the similarity between the target and candidate image using pixel-wise comparison.

### 🧬 Core Genetic Operations
- **Selection**: Chooses the fittest individuals for reproduction.
- **Crossover**: Combines traits from parents to generate offspring.
- **Mutation**: Introduces random variations to maintain diversity.

### 📈 Real-Time Visualization
Observe the approximation progress live as the population evolves.

### 🖼️ Flexible Target Input
Easily switch between different images to test algorithm scalability and generalization.
